# Golang Fishgame (WIP title)

https://behrcorp.codecks.io

## Overall gameplay ideas

Something like Slay the Sprite/FTL/The Bazaar, but in the ocean.
Game starts with a selection of 3 different fish options to add to your 'school'.
From there, the player is offered an option of 3 choices repeatedly, with some sort of boss encounter every once in a while.
Combats are an option, the school will fight an array of other fish in an auto-battler type scene. When enemy fish are defeated, the might be able to be eaten by your fish for increased stats.

Fish can be rearranged in your school.
Fish can grow when fed a certain number of times and gain stats.
Some fish might eat other fish and replace them in your school.
Some fish can have downsides.
Fish can have adjacency bonuses for being next to other fish.
Some fish might not be beneficial to its neighbors.
dumb title fishter than light

PAT
resource management with fish types breeding behind
think about job classes and how that might apply to fish.
perks?
perks as items placed physically into the background of a fishtank
sandcastle, shell, filter

APO
make it an idle game or something, constant stuff going on.
limit micro
resource management style to the game, where fish are constantly reproducing. economy of fish.
some fish make money/food, some battle, etc
each fish has some pond ability, and some way to battle.
fish has chainmail armor / fireball spell
final fishtasy / final fish fantasy

## Fish defensive mechanisms research

schooling - bonus damage (and life?) for adjacent schooling fish
camouflage - percent change to evade
speed + manueverability
spines - damage when attacked
venom - applies damage over time effect when attacking
mimicry - copy some other fish
flying - immune to damage for some period of time
safe burrows - digging / anenomes
electricity - stun when attacked
taunt - tank fish that can block or fights a specific enemy
healer fish

Initial 3 choices:

- Schooling Fish (adjacency damage bonus)
- Predator Fish (bonus to damage when attacking smaller prey)
- Venomous Fish (On hit, apply damage-over-time effect)
  MORE TO COME and be prioritized

ROCK PAPER SCISSORS relationship??? implies effective against one and weak against another
APO says use stats instead of stuff - linear algebra?
5x rock paper scissors, everything is strong to 2 and weak to 2

Pats idea: lanes, fish in each slot fight each opposing numbered fish
what happens when there are uneven amounts of fish?
can drag during battle

some kind of drawback to some fish
